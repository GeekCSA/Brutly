The term LOLBins refers to the use by attackers of legitimate software that is routinely installed on various operating systems to carry out their attack on their target. The attackers' goal is to make it difficult to identify their activity, because they do not need to download malicious files from the Internet, an action that may be detected and prevented by corporate security systems, but rather make malicious use of legitimate software that exists on the organization's systems.
